# Idea
Problem: Graphing and plotting different data sets can be a boring and repitetive work. 
Solution: With this tool you can easily browse and plot your desired data sets.

This tool allows you to browse .csv file in the GUI and graph them in a scatter plot. 


# Future Work 
A lot of work can be done to this tool; allowing a variety of file types like .xlxs , .num and more. 
As well as expanding the choices of graphs. More work on GUI to be more user friendly and host everything inside the GUI. :)
